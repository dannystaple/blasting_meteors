# Simple blasting meteors game

This is a pygamezero game with a simple and classic gameplay.
You can turn and shoot meteors, and you can use thrust to dodge them.

Game keys:

* left/right - turn the ship
* up - fire thrusters
* space - fire weapons

You score until you get hit.

Created at a coder dojo for adults, I hope this game code can inspire others to try out game coding.
